def my_function():
    print("Hello")
print("World")  #this print statement is completely independent of my_function as it is not indented.
my_function() #calling the function is necessary in order to inform the computer to read the block of code in the function.


#Example of an Indentation:
# def my_function():
#     if sky == "clear":
#         print("Blue")
#     elif sky == "cloudy":
#         print("Grey")
#     print("Hello")
# print("World")  #so this line of code is completely independent of the above function.

#A single indentation is done using 4 spaces.
# Even spaces and tabs are similarin indentation, python community suggests using spaces rather than tabs.
