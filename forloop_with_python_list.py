#for loop use garda 
#for item in list_of_items
    #do something to each items.

#for example:
fruits = ["Apple", "Guava", "Pear", "Peach"]
for fruit in fruits:  #this code is running through the loop and the variable name fruit identifies the fruits in the list.
    print(fruit)
    print(fruit + " Pie")
print(fruits)    #indentation makes a huge difference. if this print statement is indented inside the for loop statement then it is gonna print the fruits 4 times that is as much as the loop runs. But if it is indented
#outside the for loop then the list is printed only after the loop completely runs and exit.
